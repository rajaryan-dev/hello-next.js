        The End of Traditional Search Engines: How AI Is Taking Over
      </h1>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        For over two decades, the internet revolved around search engines like
        Google, Bing, and Yahoo. We typed a query, scrolled through a list of
        blue links, and manually searched for the best answer. But in 2025, this
        experience is evolving — or rather, disappearing.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        The rise of **AI-driven assistants** like <strong>ChatGPT</strong>,
        <strong> Perplexity</strong>, and <strong>Gemini</strong> is
        transforming how people access information. Instead of navigating
        multiple pages, users now ask a question and get a direct, human-like
        response — summarized, contextual, and often conversational.

        🧠 From Searching to Conversing
      </h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        The biggest shift isn’t just technological — it’s behavioral. People no
        longer want to “search”; they want to “ask.” Tools like ChatGPT and
        Perplexity AI have normalized conversational queries that understand
        context, intent, and even follow-up questions. This new way of
        interacting feels natural, intuitive, and personalized.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Imagine asking, “What’s the best laptop for a computer science student
        in 2025?” Instead of endless lists and ads, AI instantly recommends
        options based on performance, reviews, and even your preferences. That’s
        not a search — that’s a curated answer.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">
        🚀 Perplexity, ChatGPT, and the New Era of Discovery
      </h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Platforms like <strong>Perplexity AI</strong> blend the best of search
        and AI reasoning. They cite real sources, summarize the web in real
        time, and provide interactive answers. <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, with
        its expanding internet and plugin capabilities, goes even further —
        offering an AI-powered browser experience where the AI itself navigates
        for you.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        This shift is redefining the business of search. Ads, SEO rankings, and
        keyword optimization are slowly being replaced by AI-driven relevance.
        The traditional “10 blue links” model is fading, and conversational
        search is becoming the new norm.

        🔮 The Future: Search That Thinks
      </h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        We’re heading toward a world where search engines don’t just find
        answers — they think for us. Future systems will combine reasoning,
        memory, and personalization to understand *you* better than any static
        search bar ever could.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
        Traditional search won’t vanish overnight, but its dominance is ending.
        The future of information discovery belongs to AI companions that talk,
        reason, and learn — tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity that don’t just
        search the web, but **understand it**.
